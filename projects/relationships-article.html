        <h1>l've been a relationship counsellor for more three years, and here are 20 wholesome habits I've noticed amongst successful couples.</h1>
        <p class="intro">It gets better as you slide, I promise:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Resounding, frequent and genuine appreciation:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">I've found this common in every successful relationship l've been privileged to witness, including mine. Successful couples are loud about how much they appreciate each other, express their gratitude frequently over the big and especially little things, and they always mean it when they say, "Thank you."</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Recurring Affectionate Gestures:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">One thing you can be certain successful couples engage in a lot is physical affection. The recurrent forehead kisses, multiple daily hugs, handholding, cuddling, beard rubbing, hair fiddling... Successful couples are always reassuring one another of their affections through wholesome, non-sexual physical contact. A lot of times, they don't even realize they're doing it!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Respect and Admiration for one another:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples often have a healthy dose of profound respect and admiration for each other. They see one another as people who are worthy of regard and honor and they act accordingly, only bringing praise and pride to their partners.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Healthy Boundaries:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples never hesitate to set and communicate boundaries—both internal and external, and they often do well to honour these boundaries too. They understand that boundaries can be a tool for fostering relationship health, as they're more about preserving one another's individuality and nurturing safe spaces, than creating separation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Clean Fights:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">You'll never catch successful couples fighting dirty. They neither air unclean laundry nor intentionally construct their words and actions to strike the other person where it would hurt the most. They've mastered the art of healthy conflict resolution over time and as such, every misunderstanding brings them closer together.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Acknowledgement of Each Other's Autonomy:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples are able to embrace the oneness of being in a relationship without necessarily seeing the other person as a property they own. They fully recognize and acknowledge their partners as full humans in their own rights and this reflects in the way they treat each other, and support one another's endeavours.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Effective Communication:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples talk to, and with each other—not at each other. More importantly, they listen actively. They continue to nurture open communication pathways, creating safe spaces to address both mundane and difficult matters with care and gentleness, rather than passive-aggressiveness, anger or just plain ol' silent treatment.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Genuine Friendship:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples genuinely like each other and continue to cultivate deeper friendship. They act silly, play games, tease and laugh together a lot. They don't see anyone as the master or subordinate, simply as buddies. And if they weren't in love, they'd most probably still be friends.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Endless courtship:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples never stop dating. They continue to court and dazzle one another with planned events, surprise gifts, sweet words, thoughtful gestures, getaway trips, and date nights. The flame of romance is one that never goes out. It may dim from time to time, but they'l always get it dazzling once more.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Accountability and Consideration:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples are often accountable to each other. They don't live their lives like they only answer to themselves. They take their partners into consideration, act in ways that'd only attract respect and love, and are very careful with each other's feelings.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Ever Improving Sex Life:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples do not just abandon their sex lives to tumble down the pit of no return. They're often looking for ways to spice things up in the bedroom—and most especially, outside. They review occasionally and honestly, set dates, plan events around getting down, and constantly try to get better at pleasing one another.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Balance Between Agreement and Healthy Compromise:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Contrary to popular belief, successful couples do not ALWAYS agree. However, they're mostly of one mind when it comes to the things that truly matter, and when they aren't able to meet on the same page, they try to reach a point of healthy compromise that'd mostly work for both parties.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Proper Apologies:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples do not beat around the bush, struggle to apologize due to ego, or try to sweep things under the carpet. Instead, they follow the AVARCC apology framework, properly communicate their remorse, and when they promise to do better, they actually make efforts to.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Earnest Forgiveness:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples do not go around holding on to grudges that eventually devolve to resentment. They air their grievances, are honest about their processing journey, and work to truly let go of the slight and move on. Successful couples forgive often and honestly, hardly bringing up an issue once it's been entirely resolved. Disclaimer: Things that warrant forgiveness in relationships are genuine mistakes, not unrepentant cheating and abuse. This is not a validation for anyone in these categories.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Mutual Yielding:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples yield to each other. It's not always one person having to compromise, or getting to have their way. It goes both ways. And this applies to efforts as well. Both parties are consistently doing what they can to carry their weight in the relationship, and, when necessary, the other's as well.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Collaboration over Competition:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples are not focused on one-upping each other, winning against each other. Rather, they’re dedicated to winning together. This continues to be one of the most important keys to relationship building. As long as you’re both willing to collaborate, there’s hardly anything you can’t work through and accomplish together.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Adequate Prioritization:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples often prioritize each other and never fail to make it known. Their extended family, friends and colleagues are aware of just how much their spouses mean to them and might regularly tease them about it. They seldom neglect each other in pursuit of “more important” goals as, in a real sense, there’s nothing they consider more important than one another’s wellbeing.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Empathy over ego:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples value being kind and considerate over being right and blameless. They wouldn’t ceaselessly go on self-defence if it meant hurting their partner in the process. They’re, instead, often willing to admit that they’ve been wrong, then take actions to soothe their partner’s feelings. When both parties are more concerned with making each other feel seen and understood, love naturally blossoms.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Pursuit of fulfilment:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples are big on fulfilling each other’s various needs—emotional, social, physical and psychological. They make it a point to be aware of these needs, communicate theirs as well, and do as much as they can to meet these needs regularly.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="habit-title">Interdependence Over Co-Dependency:</span>
                <p class="habit-text">Successful couples value individuality as much as they value togetherness. They understand being one doesn’t mean losing your personal identity, it simply means working and acting together and towards overarching goals. This way, they’re each able to pursue interests, passions, careers and wholesome social connections outside of each other, and this further strengthens their relationship.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="closing">If you've read up to this point, well done!!! The question to be asked now is, "Am I in a successful relationship?" —Especially if you and your partner are long term, because what determines the success of a relationship isn't merely its longevity, but more importantly, its substance. It’s alright if there are a few marks missing. These things take time to cultivate and maintain. As long as you’re doing the work, you’re doing great!</p>
