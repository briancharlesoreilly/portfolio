        <h1>Project 1: Shelf Above Washer and Dryer + L-Shaped Floating Shelves</h1>
        
        <p>Alright, let's dive into this client request. Based on the photos, the first one shows a compact laundry setup with a Rheem water heater on the left, side-by-side LG front-load washer and dryer (likely standard 27" wide each, totaling about 54" across), a small window above the dryer with some folded blankets and a manual, exposed wiring on the right wall, and various utilities like pipes and outlets. The space looks functional but cluttered, so a shelf above the machines could add storage for detergents, linens, or baskets without taking floor space. The second photo is a clean kitchen corner with a marble-like countertop, tiled backsplash, a Cuisinart coffee maker, small plants, a black toaster, and an open notebook—perfect for open shelving to display items or store kitchen essentials.</p>
        
        <p>Since details are light, I'll brainstorm ideas assuming typical dimensions (we can refine with measurements). We'll lean on wormy maple (ambrosia maple) as your go-to affordable solid wood for a rustic, characterful look with those natural worm holes and streaks. It's locally available in Halifax at spots like Chisholm Lumber for around $2-3 per board foot (BF) based on current sales. Finishes will prioritize Rubio Monocoat or Osmo for easy wipe-on application—durable, low-VOC, and suitable for high-humidity areas like laundry or kitchen. If needed, we can switch to Minwax polyurethane for extra toughness in the laundry spot. Hardware can be sourced from local places like Kent or Home Depot, or outsourced to your contacts.</p>
        
        <p>I'll break it down by component, suggest options, rough estimates (materials + labor, excluding tax/shipping; based on Halifax rates where carpenter labor averages $25-30/hr, but we'll bill at $50/hr for your skilled work to cover overhead), and questions to clarify.</p>

        <h2>1. Shelf Above Washer and Dryer</h2>
        <p>This seems like a wall-mounted shelf spanning the machines for overhead storage. From the photo, there's about 30-40" of vertical space from the machine tops to the window sill (estimating—standard front-loaders are ~38-40" tall, ceilings ~8'). Avoid blocking the window or vents; mount it high enough for machine lids to open fully. It could be floating for a clean look or with visible brackets for better load-bearing (vibration from machines means it needs to handle 20-50 lbs safely).</p>
        
        <h3>Ideas and Options:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Design:</strong> Single solid wood plank shelf, 54-60" long x 10-12" deep x 1-1.5" thick. Edge it with a simple roundover for safety. Add a lip on the front edge to prevent items from sliding off during dryer cycles.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgraded Design:</strong> Two-tiered shelf (one at 12" height, another at 24") for more storage, or incorporate cubbies/dividers for organizing baskets. If they want rustic charm, highlight the wormy patterns with a clear finish.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Twist:</strong> If space allows, a full cabinet enclosure above, but that might push into mid-size project territory—stick to shelf for now unless they specify.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Wood and Finish:</h3>
        <p>Wormy maple for affordability and unique figuring. Finish with Osmo Polyx-Oil (matte, water-resistant, ~$50-60/liter locally) for durability against moisture and cleaners. If budget allows, upgrade to hard maple or birch for a smoother look (~$3-5/BF).</p>
        
        <h3>Hardware:</h3>
        <p>Heavy-duty floating brackets (e.g., Sheppard or Hovr style, $15-25 each) hidden inside the wood for a seamless float. Need 3-4 for stability. Anchor into studs—photo shows wood framing, so easy install.</p>
        
        <h3>Install Considerations:</h3>
        <p>DIY-friendly, but offer on-site install (~1-2 hrs) since utilities/wires are present; coordinate with your carpenter contacts if electrical tweaks needed.</p>
        
        <p>Here's an idea of what this could look like:</p>
        <div class="image-gallery">
            <img src="../assets/images/laundry-inspo1.jpg" alt="Wooden shelf above washer and dryer example 1" />
            <img src="../assets/images/laundry-inspo2.jpg" alt="Wooden shelf above washer and dryer example 2" />
            <img src="../assets/images/laundry-inspo3.jpg" alt="Wooden shelf above washer and dryer example 3" />
        </div>

        <div class="estimate">
            <h3>Rough Estimate (for basic single shelf, 60"x12"x1", installed):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Materials: 5 BF wood ($10-15), brackets/hardware ($40-60), finish ($10-20) = $60-95</li>
                <li>Labor: 4-6 hrs build ($200-300) + 1-2 hrs install ($50-100) = $250-400</li>
                <li><strong>Total: $310-495</strong> (Add 20% for upgrades like tiers or premium wood.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>2. L-Shaped Floating Shelves in Kitchen</h2>
        <p>The photo shows an L-shaped counter corner with ~24-36" per side (estimating from appliances). Floating shelves here would maximize vertical space for mugs, spices, or decor, following the L contour. Mount above the backsplash (~18-24" from counter) to avoid interfering with outlets or plants.</p>
        
        <h3>Ideas and Options:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Design:</strong> Two matching shelves (one per wall), each 24-36" long x 8-10" deep x 1" thick, mitered at the corner for a seamless L. Keep them open for airflow in a kitchen.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgraded Design:</strong> Three tiers for more capacity, or add under-shelf lighting hooks (outsourced to your hardware contacts). For style, go modern-minimal with straight edges or rustic with live edges if wormy maple has good figuring.</li>
            <li><strong>Alternative Twist:</strong> If they want enclosed storage, suggest corner cabinets instead, but floating keeps it light and small-scale.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Wood and Finish:</h3>
        <p>Wormy maple again for cost (~$2-3/BF) and warmth to match the wood accents in the photo (cabinets, cutting board). Use Rubio Monocoat (food-safe, ~$50/350ml) in a natural or light tint to complement the white tiles and marble.</p>
        
        <h3>Hardware:</h3>
        <p>Invisible floating brackets (e.g., Ultrashelf or Amazon basics, $10-20 each; need 4-6 total). Ensure 100+ lb capacity per shelf for dishes.</p>
        
        <h3>Install Considerations:</h3>
        <p>Easy on tiled walls—use appropriate anchors. Offer templating for perfect fit.</p>
        
        <p>Here's some visual inspiration:</p>

            <img src="../assets/images/kitchen-inspo1.jpg" alt="L-shaped floating shelves in kitchen example 1" />

            <img src="../assets/images/kitchen-inspo3.jpg" alt="L-shaped floating shelves in kitchen example 3" />
        </div>

        <div class="estimate">
            <h3>Rough Estimate (for two L-shaped shelves, each leg 30"x10"x1", installed):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Materials: 8 BF wood ($16-24), brackets/hardware ($50-80), finish ($15-25) = $81-129</li>
                <li>Labor: 6-8 hrs build ($300-400) + 2 hrs install ($100) = $400-500</li>
                <li><strong>Total: $481-629</strong> (Add 15-20% for multi-tiers or stains.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Combined Project Estimate and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>If bundling both (recommended for efficiency), total materials ~$141-224, labor ~$650-900, <strong>grand total $791-1,124</strong>. This is small-scale, so we could knock it out in your shop quickly—maybe discount 10% for combo. Profit margin: Aim for 40-50% on materials, full on labor. If outsourcing milling (e.g., for precise miters), add $50-100 via your mill contacts.</p>
        
        <div class="questions">
            <h3>Questions to Ask the Client (to refine and quote accurately):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Exact dimensions: For laundry shelf—width across machines, depth, height from machine top? For kitchen—length per L arm, number of shelves (1-3?), distance from counter?</li>
                <li>Intended use: What will be stored (weight/load needs)? Laundry: Heavy bottles? Kitchen: Dishes (food-safe finish?) or decor?</li>
                <li>Style preferences: Rustic (wormy maple natural), modern (smooth edges, stained), or match existing (e.g., white paint)?</li>
                <li>Wood species: Stick with wormy maple, or upgrade (e.g., oak/birch at $4-7/BF)?</li>
                <li>Finish: Natural/clear, or specific color/stain? Any allergies to oils?</li>
                <li>Install: Do they want us to handle (included in estimate), or DIY? Timeline?</li>
                <li>Budget: What's their range? Any add-ons like hooks or lighting?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p>This gets the ball rolling—simple, functional projects that showcase solid wood without overcomplicating. If they provide more details or photos, we can iterate. What do you think—any tweaks to materials or outsource the brackets?</p>
